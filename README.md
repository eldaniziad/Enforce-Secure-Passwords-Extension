# Enforce-Secure-Passwords-Extension
**Enforce Secure Passwords** is a Chrome extension designed to enforce strong, policy-compliant passwords during website sign-ups and logins. This extension ensures that users create secure passwords by setting customizable password policies and automatically syncing them to a 1Password vault, eliminating the need for password manager extensions while reducing the risk of weak credentials and browser vulnerabilities.

Key Features:
- Password Strength Enforcement: Blocks the creation of weak passwords by requiring a enforcing pre-defined strong password policy settings.
- Customizable Policies: Tailor password rules (e.g., no less than 16 characters, can't use disallowed words) to ensure consistent password best practices.
- Password Sync to your Password Manager: Automatically syncs the generated strong passwords directly into your select password vault, ensuring you never forget, reuse passwords or store weak passwords.
- Block Sign-up Until Password Meets Requirements: Prevents form submission on websites unless the password meets the predefined strength requirements, ensuring only strong passwords are used

Why this is important: 
- It‚Äôs risky to store passwords in browser password managers. This extension reduces the need for users to rely on potentially insecure browser-based password storage.
- It prevents the use of weak credentials that include common words.
- It blocks sign-up on websites until the password meets strong security standards, solving the problem where many web applications such as Facebook which allow users to create passwords as weak as ‚Äú12345!‚Äù. (They only require 6 characters and 'some' complexity)
- By ensuring strong, secure passwords are created and automatically synced to your password manager, you‚Äôre enabled to consistently practice better password hygiene without the hassle of remembering complex passwords.

Why not just use a password manager extension?
Because password managers don't allow you to enforce custom password policies directly within the browser and some don't even allow you to set a default password policy when creating new passwords. This extension ensures users adhere to stronger security standards, even when websites have weak password requirements. And by integrating password enforcement at the point of password creation, it guarantees that users can't sign up with weak credentials, even if they meet the website‚Äôs minimum standards. This project aims to also mitigate browser-based password manager extensions risks by enforcing password policies directly in the browser without needing to store passwords within any extension or browser.
